# **Credit Risk Analysis**

## **Introduction**  
Credit risk modelling refers to the use of financial models to estimate losses a firm might suffer in the event of a borrower’s default. Financial institutions use **credit risk analysis models** to determine the **probability of default (POD)** of a potential borrower. The models provide information on the level of a borrower’s **credit risk** at any particular time. If the lender fails to detect the credit risk in advance, it exposes them to the **risk of default and loss of funds**. Lenders rely on the validation provided by credit risk analysis models to make key lending decisions on whether or not to extend credit to the borrower and the **credit to be charged**.  

The **probability of default (POD)** is the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan obligations.

## **Source**  
The dataset for this **credit risk modelling project** has been taken from **Kaggle**.  

---

## **Features**  
The dataset classifies the **credit risk of borrowers** with respect to various features such as **Age**, **Income**, **Employment Length**, **Home Ownership**, and other attributes of loans such as **Interest Rate**, **Purpose**, etc.

## **Project Overview**  
In this project, different **learning algorithms** have been used to find the best algorithm for **credit risk prediction**. The project also addresses the **imbalanced data** and **imputes missing values**.  

**Methods used:**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbours**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Decision Trees**

## **Conclusion**  
After fitting and testing the different models on the data, the **Random Forest Regressor** performed better than all other algorithms. It was able to predict the **credit risk** on our test set with an **accuracy of 93%**.
